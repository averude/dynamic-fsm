## Introduction

Dynamic Finite State Machine Library is a flexible and efficient Java library designed for creating and managing finite state machines. 
It allows you to dynamically construct state machines by defining states and transitions between those states, 
making it ideal for scenarios where states and transitions need to be modified at runtime.

A key feature of this library is its use of generic parameters for states (`V`) and transitions (`E`). 
This provides the flexibility to use any object types as states and transition triggers.

By leveraging the power of this library, developers can implement complex decision-making processes and state-dependent behavior with ease, 
making it an excellent tool for projects requiring dynamic state management.
